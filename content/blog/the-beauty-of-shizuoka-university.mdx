On top of that, the university regularly hosts exchange events between international students and renowned companies such as Yamaha, Suzuki and industrial companies within Hamamatsu City.
During such events, international students are able to interact and get to know a wide number of companies and industries and possibly, secure internship opportunities in those companies.

The most impactful thing about these events is that, City-Recognized **"Mentors"** will also be participating in such events.
These **"Mentors"** are foreigners who had walked a similar path in Japan as international students and are officially recognized by the head of Hamamatsu City to provide support for those young international students.
Thus, international students in Japan can get the most useful advices on their future paths.
