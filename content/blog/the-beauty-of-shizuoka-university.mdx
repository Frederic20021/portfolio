excerpt: I decided to do an exchange study in Canada from Japan near the end of 2024 which has been one of the most rewarding experiences that I have ever had. Experiencing different cultures and being able to compare the different lifestyles surely widens your perspective on the world.

Yep...Shizuoka University is located in the prefecture, Shizuoka, where Mount Fuji is.
Not only is the university located at the heart of nature, it is also in between Tokyo and Kyoto, which serves as an industrial hub between both cities.
Thus, it is no surprise that Shizuoka University specializes in Engineering studies.

The university has two campuses, in **Shizuoka** city (Liberal Arts focused courses) and **Hamamatsu** city (Engineering focused courses).

# International Exchange

On both campuses of Shizuoka University, there is a space called "International Lounge" where the Japanese and foreign students hang out.
It is a space for students to get to know each other and plan events for students to get to know each other.
The events include trips and mini tours to neighbouring cities to explore the local attractions and learn more about the place.

At the **International Lounge**, there are dedicated Japanese students who will provide support for foreign students in their everyday life.
From filling out forms related to bureaucratic office such as residential registration, setting up a bank account, preparation for an interview, etc.
