Conquering Mt.Fuji has been the goals of many of those who love Japan as it represents the entirety of the country. Being the tallest mountain in Japan, not only are you able to gaze upon the holy sight of the Sunrise [Go Rai Kou], but you can also have a bird eye’s view across the main island of Japan, form Tokyo’s bay all the way to Nagoya. But like all other mountains, you will be in trouble if you do not plan well ahead for your hike. For me, it was not reserving accommodation for the night during my hike.

# Start of the Climb

You might be thinking that how stupid do I have to be to skip a reservation for logging. The reason I thought I didn’t need to reserve one was because, 1, I thought I didn’t need one, and 2, one of my friends told me that they were able to camp outside for the night at the submit when they hiked Fuji the previous year. Believing that, off I went to solo-hike Mount Fuji (Fujinomiya Trail).
I started the hike from the fifth Station at evening. Even though it was around late-August 2023, the wind at the sixth station makes it almost impossible to move on without three layers of clothing (it was below 10 C). Plus, your body sweats because it was not a walk in a park, it’s a rocky hike on Mount Fuji. By the time I arrived at the “new seventh station”, I was extremely drenched in sweat that I had to change the innermost wear. But there came my “Oh….Crap” moment as only reserved personnel are allowed to go in and out of the stations. Even the toilets are not accessible to those without reservation. So, I had to change (rinsed the shirt and wore it again) in the open gusts of chilling wind and was also looked at as a shirtless maniac which was no fun. However, the view from this height was extremely peaceful that it momentarily cleared my thoughts.

However, only reserved personnel were allowed to enter the stations, including bathrooms. Changing clothes in the open, under the chilling wind, while being stared at was no fun. Yet, the view from this height was extremely peaceful and momentarily cleared my thoughts.

### Struggles Along the Way

By the time I reached the eighth station, I was holding the urge to urinate as the last bathroom break was hours ago. Fortunately, I met a logger who allowed me to use the locked bathroom.

On the way, I saw this interesting tree filled with coins:

I imagined it was for making wishes. The chilling breeze and rocky trail were exhausting, but the thought of being so close to the summit kept me going. Finally, I reached the summit.

### The Summit and the Real Struggle

Reaching the summit felt rewarding, but I noticed something odd—no lights were on in the inns or accommodations. I found a small cave and decided to settle there for the night. However, the freezing gusts of wind blowing from an unseen opening made it unbearable.

I knocked on the doors of nearby inns for help. After 30 minutes of knocking, someone finally answered. Though initially furious, they eventually let me in after charging a fee of 10,000 yen. The relief I felt under a warm blanket is indescribable.

### The Sunrise

The next morning, I joined other hikers to witness the holy sunrise from the summit:

It was a breathtaking moment, making the struggles worthwhile.
