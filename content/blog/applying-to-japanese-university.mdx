There is no denying that pursuing studies in Japan is a shared dream of many scholars around the world across different academic levels.
A land rich in culture, with a robust infrastructure and being one of the safest countries, there is no denying the Japan is an ideal place to live in.
To aid you in your academic journey to Japan, here is a detailed guide on **How to apply to a Japanese University**.

# 1. Determining your Level of Study

When considering studying in Japan, you'll navigate through various levels: undergraduate, graduate, or doctoral.
In addition, you will also have the option to pursue an English-taught or Japanese-taught course depending on the institution.
For undergraduates, entry can be from the first year or as a transfer student into the second or third year, given that you meet academic requirements.
Graduate or doctoral courses would typical require your transcripts from prior educations.
However, connecting with professors in your desired university is also crucial as they can provide a recommendation letter, an essential element for application to graduate courses at Japanese universities.
Do keep in mind that it's important for the recommending professor to belong to the same department as your major.

# 2. Finding the university that suits you

Selecting the right university begins once you've chosen your course of study.
This phase demands thorough exploration and comparison among potential universities.
This includes finding the universities that offer your desired courses and comparing them based on the university ranking.
In addition, it is also a good idea to take the living standard of the region in which your university of choice is located, as it will help you estimate the living cost that you will likely need to prepare.
This process of researching universities and their location can be exhausting and usually take from one to three months based on the depth of your research.
While agencies can aid in this quest, their assistance often comes with a substantial cost, though the task itself isn’t inherently challenging.
Plus, most of the recommendations will tend to incline towards famous cities where they are located in cities with high living costs.

During my search for universities, I utilized the comprehensive university lists provided by <u>**[JASSO](https://www.jasso.go.jp/ryugaku/eju/examinee/use/index.html)**</u>.
These lists encompassed courses offered by every university in Japan, whether public, private, or national.
Navigating these resources can significantly streamline your search and help pinpoint universities that align with your academic pursuits and preferences.

However, there is a crucial fact that is not well known amongst aspiring students.
That is the fact that *the information presented on the Japanese version of the website is usually different in the English version*.
Always cross-reference both the Japanese and English versions of the university’s website.
Why? Because the information on the Japanese site is often more detailed and up-to-date compared to the English version.

The above images are the illustration of difference between the different versions of my university's website.
As you can see there exists a few more faculties and research department in the Japanese version of the website compared to the english counterpart.

# 3. Financing your Study

In Japan, the annual cost for national and public universities typically ranges from 500,000 to 800,000 yen for both undergraduate and graduate courses.
However, tuition fees tend to be higher in private universities, starting from 1,000,000 yen for similar courses.
These figures, alongside additional expenses for daily living and accommodation, can pose financial challenges for prospective students like yourself.
That is why securing scholarships from either Japanese government or private institutions can significantly alleviate this financial burden.

It's important to note that while the notion of studying for free in Japan exists, it's dependent on several factors.
Exceptional academic performance coupled with efficient financial planning can potentially lead to not only covering expenses but also saving extra funds during your academic journey.
Achieving this balance can pave the way for a financially sustainable study experience in Japan.

# 4. Preparing for Requirements

Preparing to apply to a Japanese university involves understanding the specific requirements of each institution.
This process includes gathering necessary documents like academic transcripts, recommendation letters, and any required test scores, and making sure that they're well-organized well before the application deadlines.
If you are going for undergraduate programs taught in Japanese, the main requirement will often be the <u>**[EJU Exam](https://www.jasso.go.jp/en/ryugaku/eju/about/eju_guide.html)**</u>, which is designed for foreign students aiming to study in Japan.
It covers subjects like Math, Science, History, Japanese Society, etc. and applicants will need to select specific subject pairs based on the course requirements of their desired universities.

On the other hand, for graduate or master's programs in English, a JLPT certificate and previous academic transcripts will be the basic requirements.
The final step in this prep phase is the entrance examination which depending on the institution, applicants maybe required to sit the test in Japan.
In the case of the entrance exam being administered in an online format (pre-arrival admission), so it's essential to follow the university's application guidelines carefully.

# 5. VISA, Setting Foot in Japan

Studying in Japan involves getting your Student Visa sorted out, and once you're accepted into a university, it will be a swift process.
After the confirmation of your admission, the university will mail you the essential documents for VISA application such as the COE (Certificate Of Eligibility) to your address, whether you are in Japan or overseas.
There is no need to stress on the process of applying for VISA after being admitted as the university will guide you through the necessary procedures.
However, be aware that depending on your local consulate of Japan, you may require additional documents and procedures such as an additional interview.
Thus, it is crucial for you to refer to the website of the embassy of Japan in your country to know all the necessary steps.

Once you've got that Visa in hand, it's time to head to Japan!
Just make sure you've got all the things in check and like any vaccination requirements, you will have to follow the immigration requirement of Japan. (e.g. Vaccination Requirements and the use of Visit Japan Web)

# 6. Pre-Arrival Scholarship from JASSO (optional)

Scholarships will drastically aid you when it comes to the financial side of studying abroad. Japan offers a bunch of them to international students, from government-sponsored ones like the MEXT (Monbukagakusho) Scholarship, Institution-based full-scholarships to the ones provided by private organizations.
Applying for these scholarships can involve different things like essays, interviews, or good academic performance. But, the trick is to do your homework early—dig deep, find out what scholarships you're eligible for, and get those applications in ahead of time. It can make a massive difference in how you fund your education in Japan.
When it comes to the MEXT scholarship, it's a big deal, but it's tough to get because everyone's after it. And here's the kicker—snagging this one might lock you out from applying for additional scholarships.
So, here's a cool trick: consider aiming for full-scholarships upfront. By going for these, you keep the door open for additional ones, like the JASSO scholarship, even before you step foot in Japan. To snag the JASSO scholarship, you'll need some Japanese skills, like hitting N2 level or scoring 200 and up on the Japanese part of the EJU exam. This scholarship gives you around 48,000 yen per month for your first 6 months to a year in Japan, depending on when your studies kick off. It's a sweet deal if you plan it right!

# 7. Typical Process after Getting to Japan

Getting settled in Japan is made easier by your university—they'll guide you through the process of getting your residence card and setting up a bank account. You'll also need to hop on board with the National Health Insurance and the Pension system, but don't worry, your university will help with that too.
Your first days in Japan are a blast waiting to happen! Dive into the local culture, take it all in, and explore this amazing country. Don't hold back from speaking Japanese—it's a perfect chance to practice and get comfortable. And hey, say yes to every new experience that comes your way!
There's a lot to do—try out cultural activities, visit historical spots, and dive into local festivals to soak up Japan's rich heritage. Want to meet new folks? Join clubs or groups at your university. It's an awesome way to make friends and really feel part of the community. And remember, if you ever need a hand, the international student offices are there for you. They've got your back while you settle into your new life in Japan.
This first chapter in Japan is all about embracing the unknown, soaking up new knowledge, and making memories that'll stick with you forever. Stay open-minded and soak in every bit of this beautiful country—it's an adventure you won't want to miss out on!
