A study exchange program is the one where two partnered universities exchange and send forth their students to study at their respective institutions. Having the ability to travel to another country, students are encouraged to learn their academic majors from an alternative perspective while at the same time, experiencing the different cultures and life-styles abroad. Depending on the structure of the partnerships, the duration of the exchange programs may vary, but it typically lasts for about half a year at a time and depending on the institution, the academic expenses of the exchange program will be covered by the university.

In the fall of 2023, I decided to apply for an exchange program between my Japanese university and the one in Canada. There are two main reasons behind my decision with the first one being the fact that the exchange program was exempted from the tuition costs. The educational expense of Canada is usually much higher and that in Japan, so it is really financially beneficial for me to pursue greater education at the same study expense. The second reason was that I could get the credits transferred to my home university with less time as the semester in Canada is slightly shorter than that in Japan.

# Applying for the Exchange Program
To be nominated as a study exchange student, Shizuoka University requires their applicants to go through two stags of procedures. The first one is the document screening processes, where you will have to fill and gather quite a number of forms and certificate for the program. Some of the documents include your letter of intention and an essay of what you intend to gain with this study exchange experience, the recommendation letter and an assessment letter regarding you from your professor, your academic transcript and the document specifying number of subjects and credits that you intend to take during the exchange program. There are also other forms of documents required for the study exchange and after gathering all the necessary documents, they are submitted to the international office of the university.

After passing through the first screening, I was informed to take the interview and I remembered that I did not research enough on the living expenses of Canada, which was one of the questions from the interviewer that I could not answer at the time. But the main criteria of the interview was not just based on the knowledge of designated country but an overall assessment of the student. For example, when asked about what I aim to gain from this exchange program and what I intend to do while studying abroad, I indicated that I was looking forward to the challenges that I will have to face during the program and hopes to improve myself as a person while sharing my experiences along the way to my fellow students because this is similar to the "Once in a LifeTime" opportunity that you will only get while you are a student.
I am sure that was not the only reason behind my successful application to the exchange program but I became a nominee for the exchange program even though I did not research well on the living expenses of the designated country, Canada.

# Procedures After Being Nominated

Shortly after passing the interview, I was informed by the Ontario Tech University from Canada after which I begin my process to apply for and request approval for the courses that I intend to take during the exchange period.

- Registering for Courses

To avoid missing out on the credit hours during the time of the exchange, it is crucial for you to plan and coordinate carefully the subjects that are offered by both your home and designated institutions.
This means that you will have to search the academic calendar of the designated institution to see which courses are offered by which department and the semester when you will be able to take them.
This tedious step is especially important as you will risk not taking the necessary credits back in your home institutions and possibly extending your graduation.

Once you get admitted for an exchange program, the designated university will give you the necessary credentials so that you will be able to log into your account and register for the courses.
This is done usually with


There were a few courses that I intended to take but was not approved by the faculty of the designated university and thus, I had to take readjust the courses that I will be taking.
