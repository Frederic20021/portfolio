title: Japan's ongoing Issue of Technical Trainees
date: 2025-01-27
excerpt: Applying to an internship maybe intimidating especially when you are still on your first year. However, despite feeling unqualified, I decided to gain experience by actually doing the internship. The topics covered during the internship was manageable, but it did not go well on my final presentation.

# Encountering with the Issue

After studying for one year in Japan, one of my professors introduced me to a friend of his who works at a technical trainee center in the city.
I was recommended to work as a free-lance interpreter at the center because some of the trainees there are from my same home country and that they also needed interpretation between Burmese and Japanese for the upcoming seminars.
However, as a few months passed by working as an interpreter there, I was notified that a fellow technical trainee from Myanmar went missing, leaving no traces behind.
According to his colleague, he showed signs of irritation and indicated that he could not handle the stress of being bullied at the work-place anymore.
The conversation logs from the app between his friends also showed that he was not able to get the help from the supervising organization.

For those who do not know, if you deliberately went missing in Japan, you will be regarded as "Illegal Migrant" until your whereabouts have been identified.
Thus, during these periods, you will have no choice but to engage in illegal activities if you want to keep your identify anonymous.
Those conditions lead the technical trainees to make a desperate choice between returning back to the unfavourable work-place or going missing, either engaging in illegal activities or return back to their country.
In either of the cases, should the trainees be found again by authorities, they face the possibility of deportation.
This is also a potential issue for Japan as more than 20 percent of its foreign workers are technical trainees and the workforce of Japan has been declining for years.

# Efforts Towards Addressing this Issue within the Japanese Society

Even though I have only met once with the technical trainee who went missing, as a fellow citizen from Myanmar, I could not turn a blind eye to it.
Plus, as a scholar who has the ability to communicate between the two languages, I felt an obligation to confront this issue with the best of my ability.
Just around the same time, I saw a poster on the bulletin at my university about a thesis contest for international students.
And the fact that this contest was also supported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan encouraged me to participate in this as I would have a chance to address this issue to the Japanese society.
But there was a small problem.

I had previously applied to participate in a six-month study exchange program in Canad, and it was beginning in a few months.
As the deadline for the thesis report was still far away, I decided to put this aside for the time being and prepare for the exchange program first.
Long story short, I worked on the thesis during my exchange period in Canada.

## **Finding out the Roots of the Issue**

To find out about the roots of the issue, I first had to learn how the [**「技能実習制度」**](https://www.jitco.or.jp/en/regulation/index.html), the Technical Intern Train System in Japan works.
According to Japan's Ministry of Justice [**(MOJ)**](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930005177.pdf), the Technical Intern Training System was first established during the early 90's where Japan would accept foreign workers for a determined period of time, as interns in industrial factories.
And there exists a supervising organization that manages the recruitment and the handling of contracts between the workers and the employers of such industrial factories.
The main aim of this system was to provide specialized training to those foreign immigrants so that they would be able to make contribution when they return back to their home country, based on the experience learned in Japan.

However, some of the restrictions imposed within this system may lead to the issue of technical trainees going missing.
One such restrictions is the fact that the foreign workers in this system are prohibited from changing their work-place, let alone the change of occupation.
This obviously would raise the rate of resignation but as per contract, the trainees would have to keep working until the contract period ends.

Another potential cause of the issue may lie in the legal violations on the employers' side.
Based on the [**Report**](https://www.meti.go.jp/policy/mono_info_service/mono/fiber/ginoujisshukyougikai/230725/3-1.pdf) by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan.

# Key Takeaways

- **Language is key**. _(Especially in speaking and writing, being proficient in these two languages will really set you off and give you tremendous advantages as a foreigner studying in Japan.
This is perhaps one of the reasons why I got through the selection process even though I was a first year student.
)_

- **Be aware of having the [***Imposter Syndrome***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)**. _(Even though I felt that I was inexperienced, I applied for the internship anyway and still got the position. The best way to gain experience is to actually gain by doing it.)_

- **Infinitely recheck your Demos, especially if it's live**. _(Nothing feels more frustrating and embarrassing than having your demo failed live.)_
